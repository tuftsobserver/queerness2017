    <h1>figs</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>you have been wanting figs all summer<br />
        i know this not because you told me but<br />
        in the way you moan under your breath<br />
        when we pass them in the supermarket<br />
        smirk at the child eating them in cookies<br />
        &nbsp;on the train</p>
        <br />
      <p>on a night when you think i&rsquo;m asleep<br />
        you tell me about the older man<br />
        who chopped down your family&rsquo;s tree<br />
        how you knew him<br />
        at times, intimately<br />
        how you continued to know him, even after<br />
        how you never mentioned the figs<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even when you saw them in a cake<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cooling on the windowsill</p>
        <br />
      <p>i buy them for you one week later<br />
        to keep with the pretending that i was sound asleep<br />
        you keep eye contact with me as i pluck<br />
        a whole one, skip the rinsing,<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chomp<br />
        down<br />
        right to the stem<br />
        you smile,<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no, not like that,<br />
        roll one between your fingers,<br />
        run your tongue along each follicle&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
        sink your teeth in.

    <h1>What's in a Name?</h1>
    <div class="content essay">
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I was born a girl, the label has never quite fit me. For years I avoided thinking about my own gender, because I had neither the words to describe it nor the courage to label it. I would write off my confusion as typical. I genuinely convinced myself that all cis girls frequently wanted to look and act and be seen as a boy. Yet, as I discussed some of these feelings with my friends, I gradually realized that my gender was definitely not part of the cisgender experience. And so began the questioning.</p>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the beginning, I tried everything in my power to understand gender analytically. I made color-coded charts. I drew Venn diagrams. I even used percentages that summed up how I felt on each day. However, my gender, fluid and flexible as it is, does not follow the basic rules of mathematics or any of the roles society assigns it, and for many years this frustrated me and drove me into a sinking sense of confusion and denial.</p>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone asked me recently what my gender means to me. In the early stages of my questioning, I would have been hopeless to give a response. Now, nearly two years after going through the excruciating process of self-identification, I have a thousand answers. My gender is my foundation. It is the person I want to be. It is the way I see myself, alone in my room with my imagination running free. It is the taste of a question on my tongue and the hesitation I feel when a stranger asks me my name or pronouns. My gender is me, getting ready for school in the dark, because I cannot bear to look in the mirror. It is me, smiling without faking it when I see myself in my brother’s old Henley, because after months of reflection, I have learned how to see myself truly.</p>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the determination of my gender came the intrinsic impulse to achieve an ambiguous, androgynous appearance; I desperately desired a departure from femininity. Even before coming to Tufts, I had already started to mold the way I presented myself to align with the way I imagined myself. I started shopping in the men’s section, I stopped wearing makeup, and I changed my pronouns. The only thing remaining was my name, which brought a whole new set of challenges. The first time I had to introduce myself on campus, I floundered, frozen with panic, and eventually settled for the brilliant solution of changing the topic instead of my name. After that, I just kept introducing myself with my birth name, because I didn’t know what else to do.</p>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the weeks passed, I became more and more dissatisfied; college was supposed to be my fresh start, and I was determined not to let my anxiety rule my decisions. A month in, I started asking people here to call me “Kel.” I have since been catapulted into a strange limbo where everyone in my immediate proximity uses my chosen name, but I still internally refer to myself as my birth name, simply out of habit. To add to this imbalance, I have not yet told my parents about my new name. Every time I call home, I hear my dad greet me with warmth surrounding the sound of my birth name, and I feel something akin to nostalgia. Somehow I can’t bring myself to tell them, knowing that once I do, I may never again hear the name of my childhood, the name that carried so much of my personality and self-identity throughout adolescence. I find myself in a difficult dynamic, unhappy with my old name but unwilling to let go of familiarity.</p>

     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the disequilibrium my name change has brought into my life, I cannot regret my new name, because it allows me to be the person I am without being so weighed down by the expectations and roles of my assigned gender. If there is anything I have learned throughout the course of my identity formation, it is that my gender will never sit still; rather, it will push me forward one step at a time as I learn how to be brave and bold in my self-expression. My name is only a small part of a much larger journey, and I know that in time, I will fill this empty name with memory and color and noise. Just as I have grown into my gender, I will grow into this new name—inch by inch, step by step, I will become the person I know myself to be.</p>

    <h1>Everyone Has an Origin Story</h1>

    <div class="italic text">
      <p>It's October 2010. My friend Paige and I are locked in a staring contest, and she's standing just a little too close to me, our noses practically touching. After a beat, she laughs and backs away, declaring me the winner and teasing me for being so serious with a gentle punch to my arm. I feel jittery for the rest of the day, and without quite knowing why, I find myself constantly gravitating towards Paige, hoping for another passing touch from her, another glance that will send my stomach straight to the floor. She is my first crush.</p>
      <p>It's January 2012. My best friend in the world sits me down on her sofa and tells me she's gay. I feel a startling amalgam of jealousy, anger, and awe. I'm mad at her for being able to do what I can't even allow myself to imagine at the time: come out. After that, I distance myself from her, afraid that our peers might think I'm gay by association. I project all of my confusion, hurt, and fear onto her, and only realize later that what I was really scared of was myself.</p>
      <p>It's March 2015. I'm watching a YouTube video on my phone under the covers, after my parents have gone to bed. The video is famous YouTuber Ingrid Nilsen's viral coming out video. As I watch, tears slip down my face and splash the screen. I don't know why just yet, but watching Ingrid tell her millions of viewers that she's gay strikes a powerful chord deep within me, and my heart aches. I go through a long period of depression, spending every day feeling incredibly alone and ready to burst because the secret inside my chest is growing and expanding until I can't breathe or think about anything other than my shame and my fear and my pain.</p>
      <p>It's August 2016. I'm at dinner with my family, and my sister is joking about dating girls following her recent breakup with a longtime boyfriend. "I would," I mumble. "I would, you know, date a girl." After a beat, my parents laugh a little and the conversation moves on to a safer topic. Later that night, my sister asks me privately if I was serious, and she becomes the first person I actually come out to. She gives me a hug, tells me that she's proud of me and that she loves me, and I feel a tiny bit of the pressure inside my chest give way. A few months later, my mom brings it up in conversation. She tells me that she thinks I'm too young to know, that I shouldn't make my life harder than it needs to be, that I don't need to make a "political statement" like that at my age. I'm shocked at what a cliché she is in that moment.</p>
      <p>It's June 2017. Almost a full year after I came out to my family. I am more comfortable in my own skin, and after graduating from my Christian, all-girls high school, I feel like I can finally see a light at the end of this tunnel. I go to my first ever Pride with one of my friends, and all day I refuse to let fear take up its familiar residence in my mind. I wave my rainbow flag, smile more than I have all year, and let myself just be for the first time in my eighteen years.</p>
      <p>It's October 2017. I am in my first-year at Tufts University. I decide that, for the first time, my story deserves to be told. I am an out, proud, queer woman. I am the sum of all of these experiences, and so much more. I deserve to be heard.</p>

        <br />
      <p>But this game of gender<br />

      <p>Its rules<br />
