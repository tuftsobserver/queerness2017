      <p>am i proud? <br />if so, proud of what?</p>
      <p>it seems like i am given this time and space to be proud<br />proud with other people that are proud of similar things.</p>
      <p>i guess i am proud</p>
      <p>but now it seems like people are watching me, expecting me to be proud.</p>
      <p>but now it seems like if i am proud, if i have this "pride," then people will continue to stare.</p>
      <p>looking <br />watching <br />staring at my "pride"</p>
      <p>but i guess i still am proud</p>
      <p>proud that i wear my crocs with the two little rainbows</p>
      <p>proud that i can now allow myself to think about a future, my future, with another girl</p>
      <p>daydreams of getting old and gay with someone</p>
      <p>shared flannels <br />a rainbow flag in the front yard<br />perhaps a subaru or two</p>
      <p>living the stereotypes <br />the good kind<br />(the kind i get to choose)</p>
      <p>no one looking <br />watching <br />staring at our "pride"</p>

    <h1>Everyone Has an Origin Story</h1>

    <div class="italic text">
      <p>It's October 2010. My friend Paige and I are locked in a staring contest, and she's standing just a little too close to me, our noses practically touching. After a beat, she laughs and backs away, declaring me the winner and teasing me for being so serious with a gentle punch to my arm. I feel jittery for the rest of the day, and without quite knowing why, I find myself constantly gravitating towards Paige, hoping for another passing touch from her, another glance that will send my stomach straight to the floor. She is my first crush.</p>
      <p>It's January 2012. My best friend in the world sits me down on her sofa and tells me she's gay. I feel a startling amalgam of jealousy, anger, and awe. I'm mad at her for being able to do what I can't even allow myself to imagine at the time: come out. After that, I distance myself from her, afraid that our peers might think I'm gay by association. I project all of my confusion, hurt, and fear onto her, and only realize later that what I was really scared of was myself.</p>
      <p>It's March 2015. I'm watching a YouTube video on my phone under the covers, after my parents have gone to bed. The video is famous YouTuber Ingrid Nilsen's viral coming out video. As I watch, tears slip down my face and splash the screen. I don't know why just yet, but watching Ingrid tell her millions of viewers that she's gay strikes a powerful chord deep within me, and my heart aches. I go through a long period of depression, spending every day feeling incredibly alone and ready to burst because the secret inside my chest is growing and expanding until I can't breathe or think about anything other than my shame and my fear and my pain.</p>
      <p>It's August 2016. I'm at dinner with my family, and my sister is joking about dating girls following her recent breakup with a longtime boyfriend. "I would," I mumble. "I would, you know, date a girl." After a beat, my parents laugh a little and the conversation moves on to a safer topic. Later that night, my sister asks me privately if I was serious, and she becomes the first person I actually come out to. She gives me a hug, tells me that she's proud of me and that she loves me, and I feel a tiny bit of the pressure inside my chest give way. A few months later, my mom brings it up in conversation. She tells me that she thinks I'm too young to know, that I shouldn't make my life harder than it needs to be, that I don't need to make a "political statement" like that at my age. I'm shocked at what a clich√© she is in that moment.</p>
      <p>It's June 2017. Almost a full year after I came out to my family. I am more comfortable in my own skin, and after graduating from my Christian, all-girls high school, I feel like I can finally see a light at the end of this tunnel. I go to my first ever Pride with one of my friends, and all day I refuse to let fear take up its familiar residence in my mind. I wave my rainbow flag, smile more than I have all year, and let myself just be for the first time in my eighteen years.</p>
      <p>It's October 2017. I am in my first-year at Tufts University. I decide that, for the first time, my story deserves to be told. I am an out, proud, queer woman. I am the sum of all of these experiences, and so much more. I deserve to be heard.</p>

    <h1>Off-White</h1>
    <h2>By MJ Greigo</h2>
    <p>
      The color of my depression is off-white.
      <br />
      I saw it today in the science complex:
      <br />
      The high ceilings,
      <br />The natural light.
    </p>
    <p>
      I passed a kitchen with two fridges, two sinks, bare counters.
      <br />
      I passed the two bathrooms on the first floor there&rsquo;s a gender neutral one in the basement I think
      <br />
      Everything for me feels like it came from a basement;
      <br />
      That same church grandma smell, the layers of caked on dust,
      <br />
      The It works if you turn it just right
      <br />
      Every piece of me is a questionable piece of equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyways I was in the science complex and I wondered if this is what god gave a fuck about.
      <br />
      I thought about what hunk of the place would mean a year of my survival,
      <br />
      Which ugly futuristic caf&eacute; chairs would pay for someone like me to get a counselor that wasn&rsquo;t shit.
